## General

### Account deletion
We reserve the right to remove expert and customer accounts, delete all data, and deny service at our own discretion. In such cases, we will refund the customers for any unused hours (unless they are already expired) and pay out the experts for any delivered and yet-unpaid hours.

### Liability
AirPair is not liable for any damages sustained due to reliance by customers on information or advice provided by the experts. Our experts are not employees of AirPair, and we cannot assume responsibility for any act or omission of any expert.

### Intellectual Property
AirPair encourages customers to request an NDA if they are going to share any proprietary information during the sessions. The NDA option – and other privacy options – are described in our privacy policy.

## For Customers:

### Submitting a request for help

**Problem description**

Must be detailed enough to provide a clear sense of what needs to be accomplished and what skills and experience are required.

**Problem description changes**

Customers have the right to change the description to add more detail and clarity (as is often requested by our experts). However, the general topic should not be changed, and if this is necessary, a new request should be submitted.

**Request cancellation**

Submitting a request is free of charge, and it can be cancelled at any time up to the point when the customer picks their expert and books their time.

**Price selection**

AirPair will make every reasonable effort to find experts at the selected price point; however we reserve the right to decline requests that are priced too low, and we will occasionally suggest increasing the price point if the problem requires more senior help than the customer had estimated.

**Connecting with experts prior to the payment**

To preserve our experts’ time, customers cannot connect with experts and interview them prior to booking them. Experts will provide a personalized note with an explanation of why they feel qualified for the request. Additionally, most experts also provide links to their Stack Overflow, Github, Linkedin, and Twitter accounts. Last but not least, our staff is involved in the matchmaking process, and we wouldn’t recommend an expert for who we couldn’t guarantee to be capable of solving the request. (Please note that we also offer a money back guarantee – see below).

As a part of the matchmaking process, the requests will be shared with in-network experts and sometimes also additional developers and general audience. This process is outlined in our privacy policy.

### Booking experts

**Minimum time purchase**

The minimum time that an expert can be booked for is one hour. This helps justify the effort of responding to requests, scheduling the session, and being available for pre-session preparation in our internal chat system (experts don’t get paid for any of these activities).

**Payment method**

We accept Paypal and all major credit cards.

**Time-dependent pricing**

AirPair reserves the right to increase rates for requests that require immediate assistance (60 min or sooner). Likewise, we may impose limitations for requests that are scheduled to take place too far into the future (3 weeks or later).

**Privacy options**

There are three privacy options for requests: NDA, private, and open source. The differences between them are described in our privacy policy.

**Bulk purchase discounts**

Discounts might be available for bulk purchases. Contact us at team@airpair.com for more info.

**How long are the booked hours valid?**

The booked hours are valid for 8 weeks. At that point, the chosen expert will receive payment for the hours they delivered, and at that point, it’s up to our experts to decide if they still want to continue working and finish off the remaining hours.

### Preparing for the session

**Communicating with the expert via chat**

After booking hours with their chosen expert, customers will be invited to our chat system. The customer and expert get their own private group chat room, where they can chat, share links, upload files, schedule their session, etc.

**Can experts and customers email with each other directly?**

No, we require that all communication outside of actual help sessions takes place inside our chat system. This allows us to monitor the quality of our service, react when scheduling changes take place, and step in when disagreements occur. Our experts are briefed to follow the same rules, and customers may be denied future service if they reach out to our experts outside of our platform.

**Sharing of email addresses**

While emailing is prohibited, sharing email addresses for the purposes of granting access to code repositories and other 3rd party services is encouraged.

**Pre-session preparations**

Since experts don’t get paid for the pre-session preparations, they are not required to put any time into it. That said, the vast majority of them are happy to do it, and it’s in our customers’ best interest to share as much information as early as possible.

**Scheduling**

Customers are asked to schedule their hours as soon as possible to avoid blocking our experts schedules. Refunds are not available if customers change their mind or fail to schedule a session within 72 hours.

**Rescheduling**

Rescheduling can be done for free 24 hours in advance, or for a fee of $20 if requested 3-24 hours before the session.

**No-shows**

Customers who miss their session will still get charged and the expert paid as if the session had taken place.

**Paid offline work**

Some requests require that the expert spends time researching the problem, reviewing the code, etc. In those cases, the customer and expert will agree on how much time can be spent on this prior to starting this work.

###During the session

**Late start**

Experts are required to wait for customers for 15 minutes; if the customer doesn’t show up in that time frame, the expert is allowed to leave and gets paid for the first hour. If the expert is late, the booked time doesn’t start ticking until the expert arrives.

**Late finish**

With expert’s approval, it’s ok to go up to 15 minutes over the allotted time. If customers need more time, they will be asked to purchase additional hours.

**Technical requirements**

It’s the customers’ responsibility to verify they have properly functioning hardware (eg: microphone), software (Google Hangouts plugin), fast internet connection and appropriate surroundings (quiet environment). A functioning webcam is not required, and customers can choose not to be shown in video (instead they can just use the screensharing option).

**Technical difficulties**

Our staff will do our best effort to help troubleshoot any issues on our customers’ end, but if this has to take place during the allotted time, the clock will continue ticking. If we can’t resolve the problem and it can be traced back to one of the customers’ responsibilities mentioned above, we will charge for the first hour and the expert will get paid – unless the expert, at their own discretion, decides to reschedule the hour. If, however, the problem is caused by AirPair or our experts, the customer won’t get charged for the troubleshooting time, and in case we need to reschedule, it will be free of charge.

**Finishing early**

If the problem gets resolved in less than an hour, the customer is encouraged to use up the remaining time by asking the expert any other questions that the expert might be knowledgeable in. That said, there’s no guarantee that the expert will be able to solve any problems that weren’t mentioned in the original problem description. If the customer chooses to leave the session early, they will get charged for the full amount of the scheduled time.

**Using a different platform than Google Hangouts**

For the first hour on our platform, customers are required to use Google Hangouts. Every other hour can be spent on whichever platform the customer and expert agree on. Please note that we cannot offer a money back guarantee without a recording of the session.

**Recording of the session**

All sessions on Google Hangouts are recorded for the purpose of monitoring the quality control, issuing refunds in case of underperforming experts, and allowing customers and experts to focus on the task at hand rather than taking notes.

The recordings will be shared in accordance with the purchased privacy option, which are all listed and described in our privacy policy.

### After the session

**Money back guarantee**

As a part of our matchmaking process, we guarantee that our experts have the required skills and experience to solve the described problem. In case of a dispute, we’ll issue a refund with no questions asked. Please note that the refunds are only available for the first hour with any new expert; if a customer starts the second hour with the same expert, they can no longer claim any refunds.

**Changing experts**

If the chosen expert becomes unavailable, customers can switch experts for the amount of their remaining unscheduled time. Once a block of time is scheduled, however, the expert is guaranteed to get paid for that time.

**Follow up questions**

Most experts will gladly answer any follow up questions, although they are not required to do that. We encourage our customers to build mutually beneficial relationships with their experts, and to find the right balance between getting free and paid work out of them.

**Finder’s fee**

After 10 hours of pairing with the same expert, customers are allowed to continue working with that expert outside of AirPair in exchange for payment of a $500 finder’s fee. We will no longer support scheduling or call setup for external engagements. Customers found working directly with experts without a finders fee will be removed from the network.

### For Experts:

**Joining our network**

Establishing developer credentials
To be matched with our customers, experts will need to connect at least two of following  accounts: Github, Stack Overflow, Bitbucket, LinkedIn, Twitter. We may revise this list from time to time, and add or remove certain account options.

**Selecting which technologies the experts are experienced in**

Experts should only select the technologies that they believe they could pass a job interview in. Being matched for

**Selection of the hourly rate**

Our matchmaking process takes into account experience as well as price. As a rule, the lower an expert’s hourly rate, the more likely he’ll get picked for customer requests.

**Publicly advertised request rates**

The publicly advertised rates represent the maximum price point that our customers are willing to pay. If there are qualified experts at a lower price point, we will try to get our customers the most cost-efficient option, which means that the chosen expert may end up getting paid less than what the customer was willing to pay.

### Receiving requests

**NDAs**

A small portion of our request require signing an NDA, for which our experts get $20/hr more than for equally priced requests without an NDA. Experts are free to reject such requests.

**Responding to a request**

Each request will be shared with several experts, so that the customer can choose between several options. Therefore, we encourage our experts to respond to requests with a detailed note explaining why they believe they are skilled and experienced enough to take on that challenge.

**Getting suggested for a request**

There are two ways to get in front of our customers: the first one is to wait until our matchmakers identify a request for which we find you to be the perfect fit; and the other is to self-suggest yourself for those requests that we share on our Twitter account (@airpair).

###Preparing for the session

**Communicating with the customer via chat**

Once customers book their hours, they get connected with the experts via our internal chat system, where they can chat, share links, upload files, schedule their session, etc.

**Can experts and customers email with each other directly?**

No, we require that all communication outside of actual help sessions takes place inside our chat system. This allows us to monitor the quality of our service, react when scheduling changes take place, and step in when disagreements occur. Experts will be removed from our network if they agree to work with our customers outside of our platform without obtaining a permission first.

**Sharing of email addresses**

While emailing is prohibited, sharing email addresses for the purposes of granting access to code repositories and other 3rd party services is encouraged.

**Pre-session preparations**

Experts don’t get paid for the time they spend chatting with their customers, regardless if that time is spent on scheduling or discussions about the code. We rely that our experts will judge properly how much preparation they’ll need before starting the session. If they are not sure that they fully understand the scope of the problem, we encourage them to invest a bit of time in pre-session preparations to ensure a successful session outcome and hopefully a long-term customer.

**Scheduling**

We strongly discourage starting a session with the customer before an official calendar invitation from AirPair has been sent out. We use our calendar invitations as a confirmation that the customer’s payment has been received, and we cannot guarantee payment to experts who start an AirPair session before having received our calendar invitation.

**Rescheduling**

Customers are allowed to reschedule for free 24 hours in advance, or for a fee of $20 (of which $15 goes to our experts) if they reschedule 3-24 hours before the session.

**No-shows**

Customers who miss their session will still get charged and the expert paid as if the session had taken place.

**Paid offline work**

Some requests require that the expert spends time researching the problem, reviewing the code, etc. In those cases, the customer and expert will agree on how much time can be spent on this prior to starting this work.

### During the session

**Late start**

Experts are required to wait for customers for 15 minutes; if the customer doesn’t show up in that time frame, the expert is allowed to leave and gets paid for the first hour. If the expert is late, the booked time doesn’t start ticking until the expert arrives.

**Late finish**

With expert’s approval, it’s ok to go up to 10 minutes over the allotted time. If customers need more time, they will be asked to purchase additional hours.

**Technical requirements**

Experts are required to verify they have properly functioning hardware (eg: microphone), software (Google Hangouts plugin), fast internet connection and appropriate surroundings (quiet environment). A functioning webcam is not required, but highly encouraged, as it helps build trust and relationship with the customer.

**Technical difficulties**

If our experts experience technical difficulties (slow internet connection, etc), the time won’t start ticking until all issues are resolved. Customers are allowed to reschedule for free if technical difficulties on the expert’s end cannot be resolved within 15 minutes from the start of the session.

**Finishing early**

If the problem gets resolved in less than an hour, we encourage experts and customers to make the best use of the time available and try to exchange additional knowledge. If the customer chooses to leave the session early, the expert will still get paid for the full amount of the scheduled time.

**Using a different platform than Google Hangouts**

For the first hour on our platform, experts are required to use Google Hangouts. Every other hour can be spent on whichever platform the customer and expert agree on.

**Recording of the session**

All sessions on Google Hangouts are recorded for the purpose of monitoring the quality control, issuing refunds in case of underperforming experts, and allowing customers and experts to focus on the task at hand rather than taking notes.

The recordings will be shared in accordance with the purchased privacy option, which are all listed and described in our privacy policy. If an expert asks to take down an open source video, we’ll do it once, although the second time we reserve the right to leave recordings public.

### After the session

**Payment**

In most cases, experts are booked for one hour and they will get paid immediately after their session. In case of a bulk purchase, experts will get paid after the last hour has been delivered, or 8 weeks from the booking date (for the delivered hours), whichever comes sooner.

**Money back guarantee**

AirPair offers customers a money back guarantee for the first hour with each new expert. In the event of disputes, the AirPair staff will review the session recording, and if we believe that the expert provided good performance, the expert will get paid and the customer refunded.

**Follow up questions**

Experts are not required to engage in additional chat exchanges with the customers after their session, but they are encouraged to do it for the purpose of establishing a long-term working relationship.

**Finder’s fee**

After 10 hours of pairing with the same expert, customers are allowed to continue working with that expert outside of AirPair in exchange for payment of a $500 finder’s fee. We will no longer support scheduling or call setup for external engagements. Customers and experts found working directly with each other without a finders fee will be removed from the network.
